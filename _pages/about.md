I'm a PhD student at Cornell University since the fall of 2015. My advisors are prof. Carla Gomes and prof. Bart Selman, with whom I study AI and its use in sustainability applications. My background is in physics and I've been working chiefly on AI-techniques for materials science, where physical laws are ubiquitous. Additionally, I've been working on algorithm design for submodular optimization, with applications to invasive species management.
