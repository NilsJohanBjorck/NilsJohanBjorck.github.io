I'm a PhD student at Cornell University since the fall of 2015. My advisors are prof. [Carla Gomes](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/gomes) and prof. [Bart Selman](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/selman/), with whom I study AI and its use in sustainability applications. My background is in physics and I've been working chiefly on AI-techniques for materials science, where physical laws are ubiquitous. Additionally, I've been working on algorithm design for submodular optimization, with applications to invasive species management. My publications are available on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Q_YY6OMAAAAJ).
